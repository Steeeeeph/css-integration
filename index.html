    <h1>CSS-integration</h1>
    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>I've created two different interfaces, keeping in mind these have to be 'pixel perfect' to the given wireframes in the exercise my coach gave me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://steeeeeph.github.io/css-integration/interface1/index.html">Interface 1</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://steeeeeph.github.io/css-integration/interface2/index.html">Interface 2</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since no points were given for working with SCSS or frameworks, I did both Interfaces in classic HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h2>Interface 1</h2>
    <p>The first interface is showing different programs presented in a vertical ordered card structure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>icon</li>
        <li>program name</li>
        <li>explanation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The cards should be stacked in one column for small screens. For all other screen sizes it should be shown in one row with 4 columns.   
    </p>
    <p>
        I did the size styling on feeling and visually comparing with the given example, using GIMP for estimations on sizes, picking colors etc...    
    </p>
    <h2>Interface 2</h2>
    <p>
        The second interface is showing a widget page with (statistic) analysis. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here I applied the tip from another coach: using the original example image as a background layer to work on.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Here i work from this background, building the container first and filling the page from top to bottom.
