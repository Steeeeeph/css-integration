##  What?
I've created two different interfaces, keeping in mind these have to be 'pixel perfect' to the given wireframes in the exercise my coach gave me:

+ [Interface 1](https://steeeeeph.github.io/css-integration/interface1/index.html)
+ [Interface 2](https://steeeeeph.github.io/css-integration/interface2/index.html)
+ [Interface 3](https://steeeeeph.github.io/css-integration/interface3/index.html)

Since no points were given for working with SCSS or frameworks, I did all Interfaces in classic HTML and CSS.

## Interface 1
The first interface is showing different programs presented in a vertical ordered card structure:
+ icon
+ program name
+ explanation

The cards should be stacked in one column for small screens. For all other screen sizes it should be shown in one row with 4 columns. 
I did the size styling on feeling and visually comparing with the given example (not with the background image-method).
## Interface 2
The second interface is showing a widget page with (statistic) analysis.

Here I applied the tip from another coach: using the original example image as a background layer to work on. 

Here i work from this background, building the container first and filling the page from top to bottom.

## Interface 3
This is a card-like interface with a big image at the left side and title with subtitle of the underlying article. Below titles some information of the account user and time info is given followed by a bookmark tab.

As like Interface 2, I worked from a background image and tried mimicking the card. 
I used grid for the structure, by first dividing 2 columns, and separating the second colomn in 3 rows. The bottom row i've seperated into 3 columns.

Except for aligning the text-font properly (seemingly the same but yet not the same) The structure is nearly perfected.
