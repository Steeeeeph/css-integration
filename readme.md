# CSS-integration
##  What?
I've created two different interfaces, keeping in mind these have to be 'pixel perfect' to the given wireframes in the exercise my coach gave me:

+ [Interface 1](.../css-integration/interface1/index.html)
+ [Interface 2](.../css-integration/interface2/index.html)

Since no points were given for working with SCSS or frameworks, I did both Interfaces in classic HTML and CSS.

## Interface 1
The first interface is showing different programs presented in a vertical ordered card structure:
+ icon
+ program name
+ explanation

The cards should be stacked in one column for small screens. For all other screen sizes it should be shown in one row with 4 columns. 

I did the size styling on feeling and visually comparing with the given example, using GIMP for estimations on sizes, picking colors etc...

## Interface 2
The second interface is showing a widget page with (statistic) analysis.

Here I applied the tip from another coach: using the original example image as a background layer to work on. 

Here i work from this background, building the container first and filling the page from top to bottom.
